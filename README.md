# Basic algorithm and data structures

A collection of javascript implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures. Includes tests and blank templates that can be used to practice implementing yourself.

How to use this for practice:

- Make a copy of a file ending in `todo.js`
- Replace `todo.js` with `doing.js`
- Fill in the missing implementations
- Run the test file ending in `test.js`
